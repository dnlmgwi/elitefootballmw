## 3. **Playing Rules**

    1. The Rules & Laws of Elite Sports Group will apply.
    2. There are no offsides.
    3. Substitutes are roll on, roll off from those named on the registration form. A substituted player can return in the same match. Referee’s must be informed of and allow substitutions. The number of substitutions made during a game is unlimited.
    4. Only players on the roster may play. All eligible players must be listed on the Elite Football waiver/roster form.
    5. All players must have a parent signature if the player is under the age of 18. If the player is 18 years of age or older they may sign the form for themselves.
    6. No player can be rostered or play on any two teams in the same bracket.
    7. All free kicks including corner kicks are DIRECT. Kick-ins and throw-ins from sidelines are INDIRECT. Kickoffs are INDIRECT. Any ball played out of bounds on either touchline will result in a throw in or kick in for the team that did not touch the ball last.
    8. On any free kick there is a 8 second rule. If the team awarded the kick does not play the ball in 8 seconds the other team will gain possession of the ball at the spot of the foul.
    9. Any less than 4 players will be considered a forfeit, at which the opposition team receives a win.
    10. The player being substituted must exit the field prior to the new player entering the field, or else the referee will award a DIRECT Free Kick (from which a goal can be scored directly against the defending side) where a foul has been committed. The player who received the infraction must take the free kick.
    11. A flip of a coin or a best of 3 “rock, paper, scissors” decides which team will kick off. Each team must stay in its own half of the field and the defending players must be at least 2 metres from the ball when it is kicked.
    12. After a goal, the team scored against will kick off. After halftime or periods end the teams change sides and the kickoff   will be taken by the opposite team to that which started the game.
    13. Shootouts will consist of 3 shooters from each team. After the three shooters have shot, the team with the most goals wins. Shooters do not have to be on the field of play to participate in the shootout. In the event that the teams are tied after 3 shooters, the kicks will go 1 for 1. All players on each team must kick before any individual player kicks for a second time.
    14. Goalkeepers may handle the ball anywhere within 2 metres of their goal.
    15. Goalkeepers are allowed to handle the ball if a teammate plays the ball back to them.
    16. Goalkeepers must throw balls in for goal kicks. No punting is  allowed. Goalkeepers may not throw the ball into the opposition’s goal. If this takes place the opposing goalkeeper will be granted possession of the ball and no goal will be granted.
    17. Positioning of Players During Free Kicks: There will be walls and opposing players must remain at least 2 metres away from the kicker. If the infraction is committed in the kicking team's defensive end of the court, an imaginary "no man’s land" sector will be established from the point of the foul to each opponent's goal post. Players of both teams will remain outside of this zone until the Free Kick is taken. If the infraction is committed in the kicking team's offensive end of the court, players of both teams must position themselves behind, or on the same line as the ball placed at the point where the foul was committed.
    NOTE: The above concept is meant to discourage fouls in the defensive end by awarding basically undefended (except for goalkeeper) direct free kicks. When taking a free kick, corner kick, or inbounds kick, a player may place the ball on the spot of the foul.

## 4.  **Players, Officials and Supporters Conduct**

    1. This competition uses the yellow and red card system.
    2. An accumulation of two yellow cards on a single day in the competition will result in the player being suspended from the next match.
